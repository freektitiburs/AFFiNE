But Catania is not only an airport destination. The city itself has plenty of attractions and things to do for visitors who want to explore its rich history, culture, and cuisine. Catania is known for its Baroque architecture, which can be admired in its churches, palaces, and squares. The city is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with seven other towns in the Val di Noto region.
 
One of the best places to start your sightseeing in Catania is the Piazza del Duomo, the main square of the city. Here you can see the symbol of Catania, the Fontana dell'Elefante, a fountain with an elephant statue made of lava stone and topped by an Egyptian obelisk. The elephant is said to represent wisdom and strength, and it is also linked to Saint Agatha, the patron saint of Catania. The square is also surrounded by impressive buildings, such as the Palazzo degli Elefanti, the town hall, and the Basilica Cattedrale Sant'Agata[^3^], which houses the relics of the saint and the tombs of Aragonese kings.
 
Another must-see attraction in Catania is the Castello Ursino[^4^], a medieval castle built by Emperor Frederick II in the 13th century. The castle was originally located on a cliff overlooking the sea, but after the eruption of Mount Etna in 1669, it was surrounded by lava and became inland. The castle now hosts the Civic Museum, which displays a collection of paintings, sculptures, ceramics, coins, and archaeological finds from various periods of Catania's history.
