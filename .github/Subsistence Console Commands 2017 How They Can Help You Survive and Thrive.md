Subsistence is a survival game that was released in early access in 2016. The game allows players to explore, craft, hunt, and build bases in a harsh environment. The game also has a console that can be accessed by pressing the equal sign (=) on the keyboard. The console can be used to enter various commands that can affect the game in different ways.
 
In this article, we will show you some of the console commands that were available in Subsistence in 2017. These commands may not work in the current version of the game, as some of them have been disabled or changed by the developers. However, they can still be useful for testing purposes or for fun.
